  <h1>Carter Karts</h1>
  <h3>Setup:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In order to play Carter Karts, open Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox
      and navigate to 
      <a href="http://karts.carterhay.net">karts.carterhay.net</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You could also host Carter Karts yourself, by placing the src folder on
        the root of a web server.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Playing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The object of Carter Karts is to win races as fast as you can. You must
        avoid touching the grass, and other cars, as this will damage your car.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Some levels are time-trials, which means you will have to race against
        the clock, while others are against AI drivers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To control your car, you should use the arrow keys, or the 'wasd' keys.
        The spacebar will allow you to drift, or power slide, while you are holding
        it down.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You may notice that the AI drivers are faster than you, this should
        encourage you to cut corners and try to hit the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_line#Apex">apex</a>
        of the turns.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If at any point, you find yourself stuck on a level, please continue to
        play it. Carter Karts will increase your time limit seconds or slow 
        the AI cars down every consecutive play until you are able to win.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Troubleshooting:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you experience framerate problems while playing, please ensure you
        have no other resource-intensive tabs open such as Netflix, Youtube,
        other games, etc.
      </p>
    </li> 
    <li>
      <p>
        If you are playing on Mozilla Firefox, please make sure you do not have
        debugging tools open. This will cause the finishline to break. More info
        on this issue is available in this
